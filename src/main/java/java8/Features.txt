Topics of Java 8

-> Lambda expressions
-> defaut method in interface
-> Functional Interface
-> static method in interface
-> Functions

-> Consumer
-> Supplier
-> Predicate
-> :: Method and constructor

-> Optional Interface
-> Streams

Lambda expressions
 -> Its anonymous(nameless) function without return type or without modifiers

 -> To enable functional programming in java
 -> Write more readable and maintainable code
 -> To use api easily and effectively
 -> To enable parallel programming




 Functional Interface
 -> SAM -> Interface which contains single abstract methods
 -> default and static methods are also allowed
 mention @FunctionalInterface -> it is not mandatory but in case we are doing any mistake compiler will not let us do

Functional Interface already present in java

Runnable ===> run()
Callable ===> call()
Comparable ==> compareTo()


 -------------------------------

 Functional Interface wrt to Inheritance





Anonymous inner class is more powerful than Lambda expressions as
with Lambda expressions we can provide implementation to single abstract method but with anonymous inner class we can provide implementation to multiple abstract methods.


Anonymous inner class can extend a normal class
Anonymous inner class can extend an abstract class
Anonymous inner class can implement an interface which contains any number of abstract methods

Lambda Expression can implement an interface which contains single abstract method(FI)

Every method inside interface is always : public and abstract till 1.8
in 1.8 default + static methods

Variables
public static final


Default method | Virtual Extension Method | Defender Method

Object class methods we cant implement as default methods in interface

Static method of interface not available to child class by default.

public static void main method can be delcared inside an interface after 1.8 v

Why static methods added to interface in 1.8V coz if we have 10 or more static functions we need not declare inside class
we can use interface for this. performace and memory will be saved

For utility functions static methods in interface should be used.


Predicate -> For conditional if else we can use predicate(FI) has test method we can provide implementation to that based on condition it will return true or false

method is "test"
Predicate Joining

p1.and(p2)
p1.or(p2)
p1.negate(p1)

Functions ->  return type anything except boolean then use function
method is "apply"

function chaining

f1 will be executed then f2
f1.andThen(f2).apply(t);
f2 will be executed then f1
f1.compose(f2).apply(t);


Consumer -> when no output is expected it doesnot return anything it consumes
method is "accept"

Supplier -> when there is no input but output.


BiPredicate --> 2 input are given to predicate

Types of Predicate ->

IntPredicate
LongPredicate
DoublePredicate

DoubleFunction -> can take double as input  return type can be anytype
IntFunction -> can take int as input  return type can be anytype
LongFunction -> can take long as input  return type can be anytype

DoubleToIntFunction -> can take double as input  return type int
(Method name is ) applyAsInt


DoubleToLongFunction -> can take double as input  return type Long
(Method name is ) applyAsLong


IntToDoubleFunction -> applyAsDouble()
LongToDoubleFunction ->

------------------

ObjIntConsumer<T> One type Int other can be any type
ObjLongConsumer<T> One type Long other can be any type


----------------------------

BooleanSupplier
 boolean getAsBoolean()

 IntSupplier
int getAsInt()

 LongSupplier
long getAsLong()


DoubleSupplier
double getAsDouble()


--------------------------------
****** ********************************************************************

If input and output are same use UnaryOperator<Integer>
It enhances prerformance

UnaryOperator is child of Function

IntUnaryOperator
LongUnaryOperator
DoubleUnaryOperator

BinaryOperator

IntBinaryOperator
LongBinaryOperator
DoubleBinaryOperator

It is child of BiFunction
*************************************************************************


Method Reference

Return type can be diffrent
but input parameters should be of same type in case of method reference

If impelmentation is already available to reuse that implementaion then we can go for Method refrence

Test::m1 --> for static methods

Test t1 = new Test();
t1::m1 --> for instance methods

Constructor Reference

Test::new
